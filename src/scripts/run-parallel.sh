# Requirements for the run-parallel.sh suite:
# Make sure the following are in your path:
# - parallelize.pl
# - process-memory-usage.pl
# - psub
# - r-parallel-d.pl
# - r-parallel-worker.pl
# - run-parallel.sh
# - sum.pl
# - which-test.sh

Usage: run-parallel.sh [options] FILE_OF_COMMANDS N
       run-parallel.sh [options] -e CMD1 [-e CMD2 ...] N
       run-parallel.sh [options] -c CMD CMD_OPTS
       run-parallel.sh {add M,quench M,kill} JOB_ID

  Execute commands on N parallel workers, each submitted with psub on a
  cluster, or run as background tasks otherwise.  Keeps the CPUs constantly
  busy until all jobs are completed.

Exit status:
  0: all OK
  1: usage error
  2: at least one job had a non-zero exit status
  -1/255: something strange happened, probably a crash of some kind

Arguments:

  FILE_OF_COMMANDS  A file with one command per line (escape the newline with
      \ to insert multi-line commands), in valid bash syntax.  Use - for
      stdin.  Each command may include redirections and pipes, will run in the
      current directory, and will be aware of the current value of PATH.
      Commands may run in an arbitrary order.  Each command should explicitly
      redirect its output, otherwise it goes in the bit bucket by default.

  or

  -e CMD#  A command, properly quoted.  Specifying -e once or more is
      equivalent to specifying a FILE_OF_COMMANDS with one or more lines.
      This option is provided so that run-parallel.sh can be used as a
      "blocking" psub:
          run-parallel.sh -nolocal -e "CMD CMD_OPTS" 1
      is equivalent to "psub CMD CMD_OPTS" except that, unlike psub, it
      only returns when CMD has finished running, and the exit status of
      run-parallel.sh will be 0 iff the exit status of CMD was 0.
 
  or

  -c CMD CMD_OPTS is equivalent to -e "CMD CMD_OPTS" 1.  When -c is
      found, the rest of the command line is the command to execute.  Implies
      -q -nolocal and N = 1.  Special characters must still be escaped:
          run-parallel -c CMD CMD_OPTS \> OUTPUT_FILE
      is a more convenient solution to the blocking psub problem.
      Note: set SHELL=run-parallel.sh in a Makefile to run all commands on the
      cluster.  Parallelize with make -j N.  The Makefile does not need any
      further modifications.  In particular, you need not escape pipes and
      redirections, since make will already do so for you.
      With -c, run-parallel.sh tries to mimic sh -c: the exit status, stderr
      and stdout of the command are propagated through run-parallel.sh.
      Add RP_PSUB_OPTS="psub opts" before the command to pass options to psub.
      Since make cannot be recursely called accross nodes, it's safer to
      disable recursive call to make using: _LOCAL=1 \${MAKE} or _NOPSUB=1
      \${MAKE} when using run-parallel.sh as make's SHELL.

  N Number of workers to launch (may differ from the number of commands).

General options:

  -p PFX        Work dir prefix [].
                It's the user responsability to delete <PFX> as it may contain
                other useful file from other scripts.
  -h(elp)       Print this help message.
  -d(ebug)      Print debugging information.
  -q(uiet)      Quiet mode only prints commands executed.
  -cleanup      Remove run-parallel-logs-* files  upon completion.
  -v(erbose)    Increase verbosity level.  If specified once, show the deamon's
                logs, each worker's logs, etc.  Yet more output is produced if
                specified twice.
  -on-error ACTION  Specifies how to proceed when a command is reported to
                have failed (i.e., its exit code is not 0); ACTION may be:
       continue Ignore return codes and execute all commands anyway [default]
       stop     Let commands that have started end, but don't launch any more
       killall  Kill all workers immediately and exit
  -subst MATCH  Have workers substite MATCH in each command by their worker-id
                before running it.
  -unordered-cat Outputs to stdout, in an unordered fashion, stdouts from all
                 the workers.

Cluster mode options:

  -N            adds a user defined name to the workers. []
                Useful when using run-parallel.sh -nolocal -e "job" 1
  -highmem      Use 2 CPUs per worker, for extra extra memory.  [propagate the
                number of CPUs of master job]
  -nohighmem    Use only 1 CPU per worker, even if master job had more.
  -nolocal      psub all workers [run one worker locally, unless on head node] 
  -nocluster    force non-cluster mode [auto-detect if we're on a cluster]
  -quota T      When workers have done T minutes of work, re-psub them [30]
  -psub         Provide custom psub options.
  -qsub         Provide custom qsub options.

Resource propagation from the master job to worker jobs (cluster mode only):

  Priority: workers will be submitted with a priority 1 level below the master.

  Number of CPUs: by default, this is inherited from the psub command used to
  launch run-parallel.sh (or used to launch a script that launches
  run-parallel.sh). It can be overridden by the -psub -<num-jobs> option to
  run-parallel.sh. Resource requirements may necessitate an extra job in this
  case. Here are some examples, with resulting job characteristics:

    psub -2 run-parallel.sh jobfile 10           # 10 2-cpu jobs
    psub -4 run-parallel.sh -psub -2 jobfile 10  # 1 4-cpu job + 9 2-cpu jobs
    psub -1 run-parallel.sh -psub -2 jobfile 10  # 1 1-cpu job + 10 2-cpu jobs
 
  The results would be exactly the same if "run-parallel.sh ..." were called
  from inside a script, which is a more sensible usage. Eg, assuming "myscript"
  calls "run-parallel.sh -psub -2 jobfile 10", then:

    psub -1 myscript   # 1 1-cpu job + 10 2-cpu jobs  

Dynamic options:

  To add M new workers on the fly, identify the PBS_JOBID of the master, or
  the run-p.SUFFIX/psub_cmd file where it is running, and run:
     run-parallel.sh add M PBS_JOBID
  or
     run-parallel.sh add M run-p.SUFFIX/psub_cmd

  To quench the process and remove M workers, replace "add" by "quench".

  To kill the process and all its workers, replace "add M" by "kill".
